Project Overview
This project is an Educational Pathway Counseling System built using Streamlit. The system provides personalized educational path recommendations based on user inputs related to their skills, interests, personality traits, and educational goals. The aim is to guide users toward suitable educational fields, offering recommendations and insights into possible study paths.

Features
Dynamic User Input: Users can select multiple values for their skills, interests, personality traits, and educational goals.
Personalized Recommendations: Based on the selected inputs, the system offers tailored recommendations for fields such as engineering, humanities, business, science, and art & design.
Educational Paths: The knowledge base contains predefined paths for each field, helping users explore potential study areas and areas of specialization.
